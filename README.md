# Scene Separation & Data Selection
This repo contains the Scene Separation and Data Selection Algorithm used for real-time video stream analysis.
> This algorithm is a work featured in [**Spatio-Temporal Reasoning and Learning 2022**](https://strl2022.github.io/).

### Slides and Papers
Go to `/slides` and `/workshop-paper` to see the workshop presentation slides and paper.

### TO DO List
> 1. add the previously implemented code to this repo    
> 2. refine 2SDS architecture
> 3. consider a **graph neural network** approach
> 4. Looking ahead - consider the impotency when GPT4 tries to process a video or image sequence? Can we integrate or enhance our methods to change the situation?
